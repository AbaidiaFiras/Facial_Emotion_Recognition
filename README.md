# Overview
This project is a facial emotion recognition system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model and Haar Cascade Classifier. It can identify and classify emotions from facial images.

# Features
- Emotion recognition from facial images.
- CNN model for deep learning-based emotion recognition.
- Haar Cascade Classifier for face detection.
- Trained on a labeled dataset from Kaggle.

# Usage
